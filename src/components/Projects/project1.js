              <p>
                DJ NeNe is a DJing business that was created by Stephanie Jeanty in Atlanta, GA.
                DJ NeNe specializes in Hatian and Caribbean music.
                The objective of this project was to create a minimalistic eyecatching logo that will help with
                the overall branding of her business.

              <h3>THE <b>BRIEF</b></h3>
              <p>
                I was contacted by my client to come up with a simple logo for her DJing business. She
                orginally sent over 3 graphic designs from the web that she wanted me to gather
                inspiration from. I study these three images to gain a better understanding of her style
                and researched DJ logos to see what was already created and popular.
              </p>
              <p>
                After my research I began the design process. I wanted to keep the logo simple but orginal
                so I opted for a modern headphone set with her name "NeNe" written out with the headphone cord.
                Once I did that I felt it was missing something and added a background color to it to contrast against
                the black or white font.

              <h3>THE <b>CONCLUSION</b></h3>
              <p>
                This is one of my favorite logos I have created to date and I enjoyed the simplicity yet boldness
                of the design. I look forward to working with more graphics like this in the future.
