                I created this cartoon character of myself just for fun using Adobe Illustrator. I took an image that I
                 had and began to recreate the picture. Because the original image was cut off I added drips to the end.
                 I used bold black lines only on the face and body to make it stand out and for the hair I used a thinner
                 line. To finish off the look and make it pop, I added a highlight to the check bones and collarbones. 
              </p>
